  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'

  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
