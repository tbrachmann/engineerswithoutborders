Feature: Managing Projects
  As a project manager
  I should be able to create and edit projects
  So that I can put volunteers to work

Background:
  Given I am a project manager
  Given the following users exist:
   | email                 | password | first_name | last_name |
   | buzz@starcommand.com  | infinity | Buzz       | Lightyear |

Scenario: Creating and Updating a Project

  And I fill in "Volunteer capacity" with "2"
  And I fill in "Location" with "Andy's Room"
